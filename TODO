For the future
==============

* Curve corrections per channel.
* Crop.
* Spot query - mark on histograms.
* Multi spot query (when pressing the control key).
* Show camera overexposures.

* Leaf embedded profiles
* fuji sqrt(0.5) factor in size
* Canon 10D presets from ExifTool

* Master reset button to set all adjustments to default.

* Add the ability to save a spot measurement, and then to adjust WB to
  make a new measurement match the old.  Usage is shooting a whitish
  wall with a white card, doing WB to card, saving wall, and then later
  adjusting wall to wall's color, e.g. for actual shots with no white
  card.

* Add the ability to have groups of saved values, perhaps one for flash
  and one not, so one can save 2 color temperatures and exposure
  adjustments for a batch of photos.

* Automatic profile selection based on camera model and serial#.

* Understand differences between ufraw with defaults and in-camera with
  defaults.  Document them, or fix them as bugs.
