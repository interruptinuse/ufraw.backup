For the next release
====================

For the future
==============
* Show some Exif Data in dialog.
* Add the UFRaw parameters used to the Exif data.
* Curve corrections per channel.
* Configurable preview image size.
* Crop.
* Spot query - mark on histograms.
* Multi spot query (when pressing the control key).
* Show camera overexposures.
* Help (based on the webpage).
* Calculate width of the dialog control column
  and set raw histogram to that width.
* Add a "Send to GIMP" option in the stand-alone tool.
* Improve the unclip highlights option.

* Leaf embedded profiles
* fuji sqrt(0.5) factor in size
* Canon 10D presets from ExifTool
* window size
* g_fopen - UTF-8
* Use wavelet denoising for noise reduction
* Show WB spot/area values in HSV (in addition to output colorspace pixels).
* Show WB spot/area values in Adam's exposure zones.
* Bug: when show overexposure is checked, WB spot counts blown out as 0.
* Master reset button to set all adjustments to default.

* Add the ability to save a spot measurement, and then to adjust WB to
  make a new measurement match the old.  Usage is shooting a whitish
  wall with a white card, doing WB to card, saving wall, and then later
  adjusting wall to wall's color, e.g. for actual shots with no white
  card.

* Add the ability to have groups of saved values, perhaps one for flash
  and one not, so one can save 2 color temperatures and exposure
  adjustments for a batch of photos.

* Automatic profile selection based on camera model and serial#.

* Understand differences between ufraw with defaults and in-camera with
  defaults.  Document them, or fix them as bugs.
