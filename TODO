For UFRaw-0.7
=============

For the future
==============
Calculate color temperature correctly
Leaf embedded profiles
fuji sqrt(0.5) factor in size
Canon 10D presets from ExifTool
support URI
window size
g_fopen - UTF-8
Read RAW preview image (parse.c)
Use bilateral filtering for noise reduction
Better EXIF support
Show WB spot/area values in HSV (in addition to output colorspace pixels).
Show WB spot/area values in Adam's exposure zones somehow.
Bug: when show overexposure is checked, WB spot counts blown out as 0.
Master reset button to set all adjustments to default.

Add the ability to save a spot measurement, and then to adjust WB to
make a new measurement match the old.  Usage is shooting a whitish
wall with a white card, doing WB to card, saving wall, and then later
adjusting wall to wall's color, e.g. for actual shots with no white
card.

Add the ability to have groups of saved values, perhaps one for flash
and one not, so one can save 2 color temperatures and exposure
adjustments for a batch of photos.

Separate display and output profiles.

Automatic profile selection based on camera model and serial#.

Understand differences between ufraw with defaults and in-camera with
defaults.  Document them, or fix them as bugs.
