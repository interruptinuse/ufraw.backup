These items are not ordered or prioritized, but are roughly grouped by
kind of change.

For the next release
====================

For the future
==============
* Master reset button to set all adjustments to default.
* Help (based on the webpage).

* Calculate width of the dialog control column
  and set raw histogram to that width.

* Curve corrections per channel.
* Show camera overexposures.

* Add the UFRaw parameters used to the Exif data in saved images.
* Display "exposure value" in Exif (Av, Tv, and also with ISO).

* Display scene zones and scene luminance (raw data with input profile
  but no other adjustments.
* Display "developed raw zone", which is zone relative to the working
  colorspace after all adjustments but before the output profile.

* Spot query - mark on histograms.
* Multi spot query (when pressing the control key).
* Show WB spot/area values in HSV (in addition to output colorspace pixels).
* Add the ability to save a spot measurement, and then to adjust WB to
  make a new measurement match the old.  Usage is shooting a whitish
  wall with a white card, doing WB to card, saving wall, and then later
  adjusting wall to wall's color, e.g. for actual shots with no white
  card.

* Leaf embedded profiles
* fuji sqrt(0.5) factor in size
* Canon 10D presets from ExifTool

* Add the ability to have groups of saved values, perhaps one for flash
  and one not, so one can save 2 color temperatures and exposure
  adjustments for a batch of photos.

* Automatic profile selection based on camera model and serial#.

* Understand differences between ufraw with defaults and in-camera
  with defaults.  Document them, or fix them as bugs.  In particular,
  exposure compensation of 0 should probably approximate in-camera
  processing, and there are significant variations.
