UFRaw - Unidentified Flying Raw
A utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital cameras
http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/
by Udi Fuchs

UFRaw is a utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital cameras.
It can be used by itself or as a GIMP or CinePaint plug-in.
It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility DCRaw.
It supports basic color management using Little CMS, allowing the user to
apply color profiles.

UFRaw was originally based on the GIMP plug-in by Dave Coffin
http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/
and on Pawel T. Jochym's (jochym at ifj edu pl) GIMP plug-in.

UFRaw is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.

Terminology
===========
This document uses the (Linux) term "development package" to denote
that not only must a program be installed so that it can be run
(binaries, shared libraries), but also so that other programs can be
compiled against it (include files, static libraries).  Many Linux
packaging systems split programs into a regular and development
package along these lines.  Other packaging systems, such as pkgsrc,
generally have a single package that includes the entire program,
including header files.

Installation
============
(If building from CVS rather than a release see also "Building UFRaw
from CVS", below.)

Building UFRaw requires development packages for GTK+ >= 2.4 and lcms.
There are many optional dependencies which enable building additional
programs and adding features to existing programs.

The UFRaw build process expects Perl to be present (for pod2man). It is
needed only if you are changing ufraw.pod or if you are building from CVS.

A modern make is required.  GNU make and BSD make both work currently.
In case of trouble, try GNU make.

Building UFRaw on the PowerPC platform requires GCC version 3.4 or newer.

The first step of the installation is to run the configure script:

./configure

At the end of the configuration you will get a summary of the
installation settings.  If most optional dependencies are present it
will look like this:

configure: ====================== summary =====================
configure: build GIMP plug-in: yes
configure: build CinePaint plug-in: no
configure: EXIF support using exiv2: yes
configure: JPEG support: yes
configure: TIFF support: yes
configure: PNG support: yes
configure: FITS support: no
configure: gzip compressed raw support: yes
configure: bzip2 compressed raw support: yes
configure: Scrolling in preview using GtkImageView: yes
configure: Lens defects correction via lensfun: no

If some of the lines end with 'no' instead of 'yes', UFRaw can still
be built, but the named option will be disabled.

GTK+ version 2.6 or higher is required for the GUI.

The exiv2 development package is required for reading the EXIF data.
Supported formats are Canon (CRW, CR2), Fuji (RAF), Minolta (MRW),
Nikon (NEF), Pentax (PEF), Samsung (PEF), Sony (SR2, ARW)
and Adobe's DNG. If the configuration script does not find this package
EXIF support will be omitted.

The libjpeg development package is required for saving image in the
JPEG format in the stand-alone tool. It is also needed to support
Kodak DC120. If the configuration script does not find this package
JPEG support will be omitted.

The libtiff development package is required for saving images in the
TIFF format. If the configuration script does not find this package
TIFF support will be omitted.

The zlib development package is required for saving images in the TIFF
format with lossless compression. If the configuration script does not
find this package compressed TIFF support will be omitted.
This pacakage also enables loading of raw files compressed with gzip.

The libbz2 development package is required for loading of raw
files compressed with bzip2.

The gtkimageview package (very new - see
http://trac.bjourne.webfactional.com/wiki) is required to enable
scrollable preview window support.  If the configuration script does
not find this package the preview window will not be scrollable.

UFRaw is written in both C and C++, so if you set CFLAGS you should
also set CXXFLAGS. If you do not set them, then the default for
GNU C is "-W -Wall -g -O3 -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer".

Other options for the configuration script are:

--disable-openmp: don't try to use OpenMP support even if it is
		  apparently present.

--enable-extras: build the extra binaries - dcraw, nikon-curve.

--enable-mime: install mime files (see mime section later on).

--enable-dst-correction: enable DST correction for file timestamps.

--enable-interp-none: enable 'None' interpolation (mostly for debugging).

--with-prefix=PREFIX: use also PREFIX as input prefix for the build.

--with-dosprefix=PREFIX: PREFIX is the prefix in dos format
                         (needed only in windows).

To build UFRaw:
  make

To make a system wide installation:
  make install

Note that the gimp and cinepaint plugins, if built, will be installed
into ufraw's prefix.  Thus, if ufraw's prefix is different from gimp's
and cinepaint's prefix, you may have to add plugin directories to the
search path, add symbolic links, or something similar.

To use the ufraw gimp plugin, ensure that other raw converters
(e.g. rawphoto) are not installed because they may claim the raw file
first, preventing ufraw from running.

If one of the packages (lcms, libjpeg, libtiff, zlib) is not installed
on your system, and you can not install it using the normal packaging
system, you can build it locally and use UFRaw's configuration option
--with-prefix to point to its location.  To build any of the above
packages download the package and type:
  ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
  make
  make install
If zlib is built only locally you will have to configure libtiff with
the command:
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --with-zlib-include-dir=$PREFIX/include --with-zlib-lib-dir=$PREFIX/lib

Finally, you should configure UFRaw with the command:
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --with-prefix=$PREFIX

Install mime files
==================
Your desktop can automatically generate thumbnails to raw files and
associate them with UFRaw by installing some mime file. To enable this
option you need to use the configuration option '--enable-mime'.
This options is limited to the GNOME desktop at the moment.

The file ufraw-mime.xml is already part of shared-mime-info 0.21.
If you are using an older version of this package, you should:

cp ufraw-mime.xml /usr/share/mime/packages/

To finish the installation you should use the following
(assuming you are using --prefix=/usr):

# Associate mime type to raw images:
$ (only needed if you are using shared-mime-info < 0.21)
update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
# Install UFRaw's thumbnails generator:
GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE=`gconftool-2 --get-default-source` gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule /usr/share/gconf/schemas/ufraw.schemas
# Associate UFRaw with the raw images mime types:
update-desktop-database

http://www.chauveau-central.net/page/c_raw.html

MS-Windows installation
=======================
Windows users can simply download ufraw-VERSION-setup.exe that automatically
installs UFRaw.

Here are a few pointers if you still want to build UFRaw yourself.

'make install' will try to make a Unix like installation into /usr/local.
'make windows-installer' will create a windows installer and
'make install-windows' will run this installer.

For creating the installer UFRaw needs to know the path to all the DLLs.
For this you should use the configuration option --with-dosprefix.
For example, from CygWin:
./configure --with-prefix=/cygdrive/c/mingw32  --with-dosprefix=c:\\mingw32 \
    --target=i686-mingw32msvc --host=i686-mingw32msvc --build=i686-mingw32msvc

pkg-config behaves differently under MinGW32. Therefore, if you are
cross compiling from Linux or CygWin, you will have to modify all the
*.pc files that come with the different packages. The following script
should do the trick in debian (update TARGET to your needs):

TARGET=/opt/i586-mingw32msvc
for f in $TARGET/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc ; do
  cat $f | sed s+^prefix=.*+prefix=$TARGET+ > $f.tmp
  mv $f.tmp $f
done

The gimp-dev package can be tricky to find. You can download it from:
http://www.gimp.org/win32/gimp-dev-2.2.7.zip

To build Cygwin binaries you can use the development libraries from:
http://cygwinports.dotsrc.org/

Building UFRaw from CVS
=======================
The development version has the following caveats:

autoconf and automake must be installed.

./autogen.sh must be run before ./configure.

The format of the ID files and of the configuration file $HOME/.ufrawrc
may and will change before the final release. I try to make sure that the
new releases will read such files correctly even if they are from previous
releases. No attempt is made to keep backward compatibility with the different
stages of the development versions. If you use the development version you
might have to delete or fix manually such files from time to time.

Last but not least, the development version is poorly tested and has some
half written features, therefore it is bound to have bugs...

Source control of UFRaw via CVS
===============================
UFRaw has a CVS repository on sourceforge.

Using the CVS, new versions of dcraw.c can be easily updated. Copy the latest
version of dcraw.c from Dave Coffin to a UFRaw working directory with the
filename dcraw.cc. Then type:

cvs update -r dcraw-original-branch dcraw.cc
cvs commit -m "dcraw original 7.86 (1.304)." dcraw.cc
cvs update -A
cvs update -j dcraw-original-latest -j dcraw-original-branch dcraw.cc
cvs commit -m "dcraw modified 7.86 (1.304)." dcraw.cc
cvs tag -F -r dcraw-original-branch dcraw-original-latest dcraw.cc

This would commit the original dcraw.cc to the dcraw-original-branch and
update the modified dcraw.cc in the main trunk. Remember to use the correct
version (7.86 in the example) and revision (1.304 in the example) numbers.

This update procedure is not foolproof. First there can be conflicts that
have to be resolved. But even if there are no conflicts, one should check
if there are new global variables or functions and add them to dcraw.h.
One should also check if there where changes to the functions hat_transform(),
wavelet_denoise(), scale_colors(), pre_interpolate(), border_interpolate(),
lin_interpolate(), vng_interpolate(), ppg_interpolate(), ahd_interpolate(),
convert_to_rgb(), fuji_rotate() or main(). Such changes could affect
dcraw_indi.c or dcraw_api.cc.

For Packagers
=============
You are free to package UFRaw in any way, as long as it complies with the
GNU GPL. The followings are just recommendations.

Do not package the executables generated by by --enable-extras. These extras
are there for testing the code during development. They are of no interest
to end user. Specifically, if you want to package dcraw, you should use
Dave's original code and not UFRaw's modified code.

Notice also that the UFRaw executables have different dependencies.
* ufraw-gimp depends on libgimp and all its derivatives.
* ufraw only depends on libgtk and its derivatives.
* ufraw-batch only depends on glib.
In addition all the executables may depend on lcms, libjpeg, libtiff, zlib,
exiv2 and lensfun, depending on the way you configured UFRaw's build.

Lastly, I'm requesting that you should consider adding a link to
http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/ where ever is appropriate on the package page.

date user guide.
